	 We have a repository of athletes.
	 An athlete has a name, height in centimeters, and a profession.
	 Typically, there is a clear correlation between being tall and
	 playing basketball: If an Athlete is tall (we define being tall as having a height of at least 180)
	 then s/he is a basketball player, and if s/he is not tall then
	 s/he is not a basketball player. 
	 In the code below:
	 Bob is tall and plays basketball, and Alex is short and plays
	 soccer, so they are typical. 
	 Frank, Shorty and Jane are rare athletes.
	 We want to print the names of all the rare athletes.
	 Unfortunately we have a bug. Please fix it. 
	 Use the opportunity to improve the code quality, until you feel comfortable putting your name behind it. 


	 *Do not change the behavior of the function "printAll". For example: When it gets a null value as input, it is expected to throw an NPE.
