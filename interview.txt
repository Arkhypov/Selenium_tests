write a script that will:
1) go to https://simplify.com/commerce/docs/testing/test-card-numbers
2) will scan each point of block "Please note:"
3) and will get card number of this point if it exist
4) if card number is found - no reason to scan further

Note:
1) Card number can be found in any of bullet point
2) Card number is dynamic, each time we load page it changes
Example 1:
 ¦ Real card numbers are prohibited and will decline in Sandbox mode.
 ¦ Strip spaces & trim card numbers before use.
 ¦ All transaction amounts used are in the smallest unit of your currency. Example: 513 = $5.13USD
 ¦ 5555 5555 5555 4444 is the simplest card number to use when testing APPROVED payments.
 ¦ Changing accepted cards in Merchant Settings will affect the behavior of the test card numbers.

Example 2:
 ¦ Real card number is 5455 3307 6000 0018 prohibited and will decline in Sandbox mode.
 ¦ Strip spaces & trim card numbers before use.
 ¦ All transaction amounts used are in the smallest unit of your currency. Example: 513 = $5.13USD
 ¦ The simplest card number to use when testing APPROVED payments.
 ¦ Changing accepted cards in Merchant Settings will affect the behavior of the test card numbers.

write a script that will go to https://developer.mastercard.com/account/sign-up
1) will click on captcha and will wait for captcha modal window will appear
if it appear - script sleeps 2 minutes
if it is not appeared it will continue running

2) will click on 'sign up' button and verify error message text of each unfilled element
Note:
static is just id of each field and tag name of error text

A string of brackets is balanced under the following conditions:

 ¦    It is the empty string.
 ¦    If a and b are balanced, then ab is balanced.
 ¦    If a is balanced, then (a) and {a} are balanced.
Some examples of balanced strings are {}(), {()}, and ({()}).
Some examples of unbalanced strings are {}(, ({)}, ((, and }{.
The locked portion of the editor contains the declaration for a class named Solution with a main method that does the following:

 ¦    Creates a Parser object.
 ¦    Reads an unknown number of strings from stdin.
 ¦    Passes each string as an argument to the Parser object's isBalanced method and prints value returned by the method on a new line.

Sample Input: 0
"{}()", "({()})", "{}("
Sample Output 0
"true", "true", "false"
Explanation 0

 ¦ {}() contains two adjacent balanced strings, {} and (), so we return true.

 ¦ ({()}) contains a balanced string, (), nested inside another balanced string, {}, nested inside another balanced string, (). Thus, we return true.

 ¦ {}( contains a balanced string, {}, followed by an unbalanced string, (. Thus, we return false.
